# Archived manifests

The resources under this directory are kept for reference only and are not
included in any current Kustomize overlays. In particular, the former
CloudNativePG experiments now live in `k8s/archive/cnpg` so it is clear that
the active deployment relies on the Apache AGE container instead.
