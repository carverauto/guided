> A Protocol and Service for Building Great and Secure Software with AI Agents

Guided.dev provides the missing link between AI coding assistants and best-practice software development: a curated knowledge graph of secure coding patterns, vulnerabilities, and architectural guidance, accessible via a standardized protocol.

## What is Guided.dev?

Guided.dev consists of two key innovations:

1. **A Curated Knowledge Graph**: A security-first knowledge base built on PostgreSQL with Apache AGE, containing:
   - Technologies and frameworks
   - Security vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
   - Best practices and secure coding patterns
   - Deployment strategies
   - Architectural guidance

2. **The AGENTS.md Protocol**: A machine-readable specification that tells AI agents how to discover and interact with our guidance service, enabling structured, secure, and expert-informed development.

## Current Status

**Phase 0** (Foundation & Setup) - **Complete** ✓
**Phase 1** (Admin CRUD Interface) - **Complete** ✓
**Phase 2** (MCP Server) - **In Progress** 🚧

### Completed
- ✓ PostgreSQL with Apache AGE graph database
- ✓ Graph query interface (`Guided.Graph`)
- ✓ Initial knowledge base (24 nodes, 24 relationships)
- ✓ Custom mix tasks for setup and seeding
- ✓ Admin CRUD interface with Phoenix LiveView
- ✓ Knowledge graph management UI

**Currently Working On**: MCP Server API endpoints

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites**: Erlang/OTP 28+, Elixir 1.19.1+, Docker

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/carverauto/guided.git
cd guided

# Run the automated setup script
./scripts/dev_setup.sh

# Start the Phoenix server
mix phx.server
```

Visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

For detailed setup instructions and manual installation, see [**docs/DEVELOPMENT.md**](guided/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Project Vision

### The Problem

LLMs are powerful code generators but they operate in a vacuum. They often produce code that is functional but naive in its architecture, security, and scalability. There's no standardized way for AI agents to discover and consume curated best-practice knowledge.

### The Solution

**Guided.dev** provides:
- A **trusted source** of security-first, opinionated guidance
- A **clear protocol** (AGENTS.md) for AI agents to consume this guidance
- A **graph-based knowledge model** for complex relationships between technologies, vulnerabilities, and mitigations

### Example Use Case

An AI agent building a Python web app:
1. Discovers the project's `AGENTS.md` file
2. Queries guided.dev's MCP server for tech stack recommendations
3. Receives guidance on Streamlit + SQLite with security advisories
4. Queries for secure coding patterns specific to those technologies
5. Generates code using parameterized queries and proper input validation

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Elixir / Phoenix Framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Apache AGE extension (graph database)
- **Frontend**: Phoenix LiveView
- **Query Language**: openCypher
- **API**: Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## Features

### Completed

**Phase 0** (Foundation):
- ✓ PostgreSQL with Apache AGE graph database
- ✓ openCypher query interface
- ✓ Initial knowledge base covering:
  - Python, Streamlit, SQLite, FastAPI
  - OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
  - Security controls and mitigations
  - Best practices and deployment patterns

**Phase 1** (Admin Interface):
- ✓ LiveView-based admin CRUD interface
- ✓ Node and relationship management
- ✓ Knowledge graph dashboard
- ✓ Graph visualization

### In Progress

**Phase 2** (MCP Server):
- Public-facing MCP API
- Three core endpoints:
  - `tech_stack_recommendation`
  - `secure_coding_pattern`
  - `deployment_guidance`

### Future Roadmap

- Expanded knowledge domains (JavaScript, Go, Rust, etc.)
- Community contribution system
- IDE integrations
- Advanced graph analytics and insights

## Development

For detailed setup instructions, see [**docs/DEVELOPMENT.md**](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Run tests
mix test

# Format code
mix format

# Full pre-commit check (compile, format, test)
mix precommit

# Reset database and graph
mix ecto.reset
mix graph.setup
mix graph.seed

# Start Phoenix server
mix phx.server

# Start with IEx (interactive Elixir)
iex -S mix phx.server
```

### Testing the Graph

```elixir
# In IEx
iex> Guided.Graph.query("MATCH (t:Technology) RETURN t.name")
{:ok, [["Python"], ["Streamlit"], ["SQLite"], ["FastAPI"]]}

iex> Guided.Graph.query("""
  MATCH (t:Technology {name: 'Streamlit'})-[:HAS_VULNERABILITY]->(v:Vulnerability)
  RETURN v.name, v.severity
  """)
{:ok, [["Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)", "high"], ["Path Traversal", "high"]]}
```
