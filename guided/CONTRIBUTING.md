## Coding Standards

### Elixir Style Guide

We follow the [Elixir Style Guide](https://github.com/christopheradams/elixir_style_guide) with a few additions:

1. **Formatting**: Always run `mix format` before committing
   ```bash
   mix format
   ```

2. **Documentation**: Add `@moduledoc` and `@doc` to all public modules and functions
   ```elixir
   defmodule Guided.NewModule do
     @moduledoc """
     Brief description of what this module does.
     """

     @doc """
     Brief description of what this function does.

     ## Examples

         iex> NewModule.function_name(arg)
         {:ok, result}
     """
     def function_name(arg) do
       # implementation
     end
   end
   ```

3. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Use `snake_case` for functions and variables
   - Use `CamelCase` for modules
   - Use descriptive names

4. **Pattern Matching**: Use pattern matching for clarity
   ```elixir
   # Good
   def process({:ok, result}), do: result
   def process({:error, reason}), do: handle_error(reason)

   # Less ideal
   def process(result) do
     case result do
       {:ok, value} -> value
       {:error, reason} -> handle_error(reason)
     end
   end
   ```

5. **Pipes**: Use the pipe operator for function chains
   ```elixir
   # Good
   data
   |> transform()
   |> validate()
   |> save()

   # Less ideal
   save(validate(transform(data)))
   ```

### Graph Database Conventions

When working with the knowledge graph:

1. **Node Labels**: Use singular nouns in PascalCase
   - `Technology`, `Vulnerability`, `BestPractice`

2. **Relationship Types**: Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
   - `RECOMMENDED_FOR`, `HAS_VULNERABILITY`, `MITIGATED_BY`

3. **Properties**: Use `snake_case` for property names
   - `name`, `severity`, `owasp_rank`

4. **Cypher Queries**: Format for readability
   ```elixir
   query = """
   MATCH (t:Technology {name: $tech_name})
         -[:HAS_VULNERABILITY]->(v:Vulnerability)
         -[:MITIGATED_BY]->(sc:SecurityControl)
   RETURN t.name, v.name, sc.name
   ORDER BY v.severity DESC
   """
   ```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
mix test

# Run a specific test file
mix test test/guided/graph_test.exs

# Run tests with coverage
mix test --cover
```

### Writing Tests

1. **Test file naming**: `test/path/to/module_test.exs`
2. **Describe blocks**: Group related tests
   ```elixir
   defmodule Guided.GraphTest do
     use Guided.DataCase

     describe "create_node/2" do
       test "creates a node with valid attributes" do
         assert {:ok, _} = Graph.create_node("Technology", %{name: "Test"})
       end

       test "returns error with invalid attributes" do
         assert {:error, _} = Graph.create_node("Technology", %{})
       end
     end
   end
   ```

3. **Test coverage**: Aim for >80% coverage on new code
4. **Edge cases**: Test error conditions and edge cases

## Documentation

### Types of Documentation

1. **Code Documentation**: Add `@doc` to public functions
2. **README**: Keep the main README up to date
3. **Development Guide**: Update `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` for setup changes
4. **Inline Comments**: Explain complex logic

### Documentation Standards

- Use proper grammar and punctuation
- Be concise but complete
- Include examples where helpful
- Keep documentation in sync with code
