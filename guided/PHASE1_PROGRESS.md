# Phase 1 Progress: Admin CRUD Interface

## âœ“ Completed

### 1. Authentication System
- Generated Phoenix authentication with `mix phx.gen.auth`
- Email/password based user accounts
- Protected admin routes requiring authentication
- Created test admin account: `admin@guided.dev`

### 2. Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)
- Overview dashboard showing graph statistics
- Node count, edge count by type
- Color-coded cards for different node types
- Quick action buttons for common tasks

### 3. Technologies Management (`/admin/technologies`)
- Full CRUD interface for Technology nodes
- List view with sortable columns
- Modal-based create/edit forms
- Fields: name, category, version, maturity, security_rating, description
- Color-coded status badges
- Delete with confirmation

### 4. Core UI Components
Added to `core_components.ex`:
- `modal/1` - Modal dialog component
- `simple_form/1` - Form wrapper with actions slot

## ðŸ”¨ Ready to Build Next

The following LiveView modules still need to be created (stub routes exist):

### Vulnerabilities (`/admin/vulnerabilities`)
Similar to Technologies, but for Vulnerability nodes with fields:
- name, owasp_rank, severity, description, cwe

### Security Controls (`/admin/security_controls`)
For SecurityControl nodes with fields:
- name, category, implementation_difficulty, description

### Best Practices (`/admin/best_practices`)
For BestPractice nodes with fields:
- name, technology, category, description, code_example

### Relationship Manager (`/admin/relationships`)
The most important piece - allows creating edges between nodes:
- Select source node type and specific node
- Select relationship type (RECOMMENDED_FOR, HAS_VULNERABILITY, etc.)
- Select target node type and specific node
- Create the relationship in the graph

## ðŸš€ How to Test

1. **Start the server** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   mix phx.server
   ```

2. **Visit the app**:
   ```
   http://localhost:4000
   ```

3. **Register/Login**:
   - Go to http://localhost:4000/users/register
   - Or login at http://localhost:4000/users/log-in with `admin@guided.dev`
   - Check `/dev/mailbox` for the magic link

4. **Access Admin Dashboard**:
   ```
   http://localhost:4000/admin
   ```

5. **Manage Technologies**:
   ```
   http://localhost:4000/admin/technologies
   ```
   - Click "New Technology" to add nodes
   - Click rows to edit
   - Test delete functionality

## ðŸ“Š Current Graph Stats

Run `mix graph.seed` to reset with initial data:
- 24 nodes total
- 4 Technologies (Python, Streamlit, SQLite, FastAPI)
- 4 Vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, XSS, etc.)
- 6 Security Controls
- 4 Best Practices
- 3 Use Cases
- 3 Deployment Patterns
- 24 relationships

## Next Steps

Would you like me to:
1. **Build the remaining LiveViews** (Vulnerabilities, Controls, Practices)
2. **Build the Relationship Manager** (the coolest part!)
3. **Add graph visualization** to the dashboard
4. **Move to Phase 2** (MCP API endpoints)

The Relationship Manager is particularly important - it's what makes the knowledge graph actually useful!
