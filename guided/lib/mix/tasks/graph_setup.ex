  Nodes:
  - Concept: High-level concepts in software development
  - Technology: Specific technologies (languages, frameworks, tools)
  - UseCase: Common use cases and scenarios
  - BestPractice: Recommended practices and patterns
  - DeploymentPattern: Deployment strategies and patterns
  - Vulnerability: Known security vulnerabilities
  - SecurityControl: Security controls and mitigations

  Relationships:
  - RECOMMENDED_FOR: Technology -> UseCase
  - HAS_BEST_PRACTICE: Technology -> BestPractice
  - HAS_VULNERABILITY: Technology -> Vulnerability
  - MITIGATED_BY: Vulnerability -> SecurityControl
  - IMPLEMENTS_CONTROL: BestPractice -> SecurityControl
